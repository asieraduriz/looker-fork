# Looker Components Examples

This repository indexes several examples built using the [Looker Components](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/components).

## What are Looker components? 
<br>

Looker components are React-based, pre-built pieces of Looker's application. Within the suite of Looker components there are UI components, filter components, and visualization components. Application developers can use components in data applications and extensions that are built on top of Looker. To see a full list of Looker's components, visit the [Looker Developer Portal](https://developers.looker.com/components/overview/).

Components can be used with the [Looker extension framework](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/intro-to-extension-framework), Looker's [Extension SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@looker/extension-sdk), Looker's [Embed SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@looker/embed-sdk), and Looker's [TypeScript/JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@looker/sdk).
